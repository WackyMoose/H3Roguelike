### Unique Selling Points:
The enemies have a specific attack pattern, this introduces a opportunity for the player to grow their skill.</br>

### Core Mechanics:
Player will have the ability to choose to attack, block in choosen direction or wait a turn, 
this will take a turn and then give the aggroed enemies their turn.

The players character will earn XP for killing enemies and/or completing quests, after X amount of XP the character will level up, giving the player X stat point to increase their characters stats making them stronger.

When the players characters health reached 0 or below it dies, this is permanent and will prompt the player to create a new character.

The player will after their character dies keep some part of the progress, this will make their next run a bit easier.
